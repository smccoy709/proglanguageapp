# Coding Log
Learn how to code by keeping track of which programming languages you want to learn how to code and checking off the ones you have completed.  You can also delete the ones you no longer wish to learn.

You can simply click the textbox at the bottom of the app to add a new programming language to your log.  You can click the checkbox to mark a programming language as "learned" (otherwise known as "completed") so you can keep track of everything you have learned and would like to learn.  You can also uncheck the box to remove the checkmark if there is something else you forgot to learn and want to mark the language as "uncompleted" (or "unlearned").

A user may no longer want to learn how to program in a language that is on the list.  They can fix this issue by deleting the language in the list by pressing the trash can icon.  Doing so will allow the language listed in the log to be deleted and can be readded to the log by using the "Add a Programming Language" textbox.

The log works for both iOS and Android devices.  It was created using React Native, JavaScript, and CSS.  Testing was done using Expo on my iPhone 11 Max Pro and using Expo on the Android Emulator (through the Android Studio app) from a Windows computer (the Android device tested on was the Pixel 7 API 34).
